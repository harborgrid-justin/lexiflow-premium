================================================================================
                             IMPORTANT DECISIONS
================================================================================

✓ Code-First GraphQL Approach (NestJS @nestjs/graphql decorators)
✓ TypeORM for Database ORM (PostgreSQL optimized)
✓ Bull + Redis for Background Job Processing
✓ DataLoader Pattern for N+1 Query Prevention
✓ JWT Authentication with Refresh Tokens
✓ Row-Level Security (RLS) for Multi-tenant Data Isolation
✓ Comprehensive Audit Logging for Compliance
✓ File Storage: Local with Organized Directory Structure
✓ API Versioning via URL Path (/api/v1)
✓ Rate Limiting & Throttling for API Protection
✓ Docker Compose for Development Infrastructure
✓ Comprehensive Seed Data for Testing
✓ WebSocket for Real-time Features
✓ React Router v7 for Frontend Routing
✓ Context API for State Management
✓ Custom Hooks for Business Logic
✓ Error Boundaries for Fault Tolerance
✓ Virtual Scrolling for Performance
✓ TypeScript for Type Safety (Frontend + Backend)

================================================================================
                               KNOWN ISSUES
================================================================================

1. Service Layer Integration:
   - GraphQL resolvers have placeholder service calls
   - Need to implement full service methods
   - Uncomment service calls once services are ready

2. Authentication Guards:
   - Guards are configured but need JWT strategy implementation
   - CurrentUser decorator needs full implementation

3. File Upload:
   - Basic file upload configured
   - Need to add file size limits and type validation
   - Consider cloud storage (S3) for production

4. Email Service:
   - SMTP configured but needs credentials
   - Email templates need to be created

5. OCR Processing:
   - Tesseract.js configured but needs testing
   - Performance optimization needed for large documents

6. Database Migrations:
   - Entities created but migrations need to be generated
   - Run: npm run migration:generate

7. Environment Variables:
   - .env.example provided but needs actual values
   - JWT secrets need to be changed for production

8. Testing:
   - Test infrastructure created
   - Unit tests need to be written
   - E2E tests need to be implemented

9. Production Readiness:
   - Need to configure HTTPS/SSL
   - Need to set up load balancing
   - Need to configure CDN for frontend assets
   - Need to set up monitoring (Sentry, etc.)
