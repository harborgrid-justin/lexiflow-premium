##  ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLES

### 1. Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- Bounded contexts align with primary domains
- Aggregate roots enforce transactional consistency
- Domain events enable loose coupling

### 2. Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)
- Integration orchestrator publishes domain events
- Async event handlers for cross-domain workflows
- Event sourcing for audit trails

### 3. Repository Pattern with Caching
- LRU cache for frequently accessed entities
- Query client for optimistic UI updates
- Offline-first sync engine with conflict resolution

### 4. Microservices-Ready Monolith
- Each primary domain is independently deployable
- API gateway pattern for external integrations
- Service mesh for observability
