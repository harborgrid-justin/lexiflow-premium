 * Shared Components
 * 
 * Cross-feature components that are used by multiple feature modules.
 * These are business-logic components, not pure UI primitives.
 * For UI primitives, use @/components instead.

// Export shared components here as they are created
// Example:
// export { DocumentPreview } from './DocumentPreview';
// export { EntityCard } from './EntityCard';
